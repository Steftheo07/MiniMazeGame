# MiniMazeGame
this is a small maze game I found on github but I made it better
# Description
When you first open the game you will notice that it is not possible to reach the end and thats because there are secret doors in the game that open/disapear when the player sprite touches them
# IMPORTANT!!!
To be able to hear the music of the project you will have to download it from here https://www.mediafire.com/file/o3x4cfgz6orix5k/music.wav/file since it is more than 25mb and I cant upload it on github. Simply download it and put it in the same folder with MazeGame.py
